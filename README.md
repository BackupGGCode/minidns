#MiniDNS
Sometimes you just want to set up a minimal DNS server for testing, and you don't want to spend all day resolving dependencies or creating configuration files.

MiniDNS is a very simple DNS server written in Python that resolves all DNS queries to a single IPv4 address. No configuration files, no additional dependencies, one command and you're up and running.
